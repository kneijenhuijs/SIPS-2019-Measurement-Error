Lack of consensus on taxonomy, terminology, and definitions has led to confusion about which measurement properties are relevant and which concepts they represent. The aim was to clarify and standardize terminology and definitions of measurement properties by reaching consensus among a group of experts and to develop a taxonomy of measurement properties relevant for evaluating health instruments. 

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING
An international Delphi study with four written rounds was performed. Participating experts had a background in epidemiology, statistics, psychology, and clinical medicine. The panel was asked to rate their (dis)agreement about proposals on a five-point scale. Consensus was considered to be reached when at least 67{\%} of the panel agreed. 

RESULTS
Of 91 invited experts, 57 agreed to participate and 43 actually participated. Consensus was reached on positions of measurement properties in the taxonomy (68–84{\%}), terminology (74–88{\%}, except for structural validity [56{\%}]), and definitions of measurement properties (68–88{\%}). The panel extensively discussed the positions of internal consistency and responsiveness in the taxonomy, the terms “reliability” and “structural validity,” and the definitions of internal consistency and reliability. 

CONCLUSIONS
Consensus on taxonomy, terminology, and definitions of measurement properties was reached. Hopefully, this will lead to a more uniform use of terms and definitions in the literature on measurement properties.},
